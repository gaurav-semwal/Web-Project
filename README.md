# 💖 Valentine’s Day Web Project

### Made with ❤️ by Gaurav Semwal (for my friends)

I created this fun Valentine’s Day web project just for learning and sharing some joy with my friends.  
It’s a simple, interactive web app with a **glassmorphism UI**, playful animations, and cute button effects — perfect for sending a Valentine message to someone special.
